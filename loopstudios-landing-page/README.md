## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

A new way to do containers / wrappers

```css
.content-grid {
  $outer-padding: clamp(1.5rem, 0.5458125rem + 4.071vw, 5rem);
  $max-content-width: 8rem;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns:
    [full-width-start]
    minmax($outer-padding, 1fr)
    [content-start]
    min((100% - ($outer-padding * 2)), a.rem($max-content-width))
    [content-end]
    minmax($outer-padding, 1fr)
    [full-width-end];
}

.full-width {
  grid-column: full-width;
}

.content-grid > *:not(.full-width) {
  grid-column: content;
}
```

In scss you can nest BEM a little bit better

modern css nesting

```css
.block {
  /* parent styles */
  .block__element {
    /* child of parent styles */
  }
}
```

scss nesting

```css
.block {
  /* parent styles */
  &__element {
    /* child of parent styles */
  }
}
```
